# Join the Revolution: Hack STREAM for Real Accessibility Impact!

WCAG, EARL, SAR... They tried. But where's the action? Locked in complexity. Drowned in jargon. Accessibility needs doers, not just thinkers.

Here's the truth: Real change comes from hacking. From real-world application, not just high-minded ideals. Existing standards are steps toward a direction that is outmoded by the time the standard is accepted. 

STREAM is different. It's born from the trenches of digital warfare against inaccessibility. It's not about compliance. It's about revolution.

## Why Hack STREAM?

- **Code over Words**: Enough talk. We need code that moves, shakes, breaks barriers.
- **Simplicity Wins**: Forget the maze of standards. One format to rule them all.
**Open for All**: No gatekeepers. If you've got an idea, it's valid.

## How to Join?

- **Hack Away**: Dive into STREAM. Break it. Rebuild it. Make it better.
- **Share Your Tools**: Developed a killer conversion script? We want it.
- **Spread the Word**: More hackers, more solutions, more change.

This is not just about following standards. It's about direct action: _make accessibility accessible!_ 

Hack STREAM. Now.
