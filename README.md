# Equalify STREAM Formatter
Streamline Results of Accessibility Tests

## Problem
Accessibility testing results are in lots of different formats. Moreover, different formats lead to confusion about what test does what, which leads to duplicate work. We want to prevent duplicate work.

## Solution
Standardized Test Results for Equal Accessibility Measures (STREAM). STREAM aims to: 
1) Retain information that's useful to fix and record reported violations and succeses.
2) Be human-readable.

In doing that work, STREAM helps testing providers focus on unique tests that their tools provide. STREAM also establishes a baseline so we can easily assess results of different tools.

## Process
To work toward the solution, Equalify is building a tool that converts different testing results into STREAM format. By doing so, we will be able to develop STREAM into a schema that works for as many tools as possible.

## Using the App
