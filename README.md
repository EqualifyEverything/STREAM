# STREAM 
Standardized Test Results for Equal Accessibility Measurement (STREAM)

## Problem
Accessibility testing results are in lots of different formats. Moreover, different formats lead to confusion about what test does what, which leads to duplicate work. We want to prevent duplicate work.

## Solution
STREAM aims to: 
1) Retain information that's useful to fix and record reported violations and succeses.
2) Be human-readable.

In other words, we're streamlining accessibility testing results.

In doing so, STREAM helps testing providers focus on unique tests that their tools provide. STREAM also establishes a baseline so we can easily assess results of different tools.

## Process
To work toward the solution, Equalify is building a tool to convert different testing results into STREAM format. That process will help us develop STREAM into a schema that works for as many tools as possible.

## Contribute
This repo containts the base [STREAM schema](/stream-schema.json) and code relating to reformatting testing services into STREAM.
